My Aerospace configuration that has:
- Multi monitor setup: Two monitors are supported as of now.
- Mouse follow enabled: Mouse follows the active workspace monitor.
- full screen. Default config from Aerospace does not come with full screen support.
  This config supports fullscreen. This is also not the default Mac Fullscreen.
  While that works too, there is a bit of issue with Mac's default fullscreen.
  The workspaces disorient and change positions automatically when toggling using native Mac full screen
